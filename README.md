### print("Hello, world! I'm Sara Sánchez 👋")

Resolute, methodical, and enthusiastic. I studied two bachelor’s degrees in Economics and International Relations.

After an initial stage in HR, I set out to prepare for high-level civil service exams while developing my own digital project. However, in 2022 I decided to join a startup where I have enjoyed managing a multinational team and taking charge of multiple key areas of a fast-growing company.

Now, after enhancing my skills in Data Analysis & Business Intelligence, <b>I'm seeking a position that allows me to integrate my training and experience in the field of business strategy!
